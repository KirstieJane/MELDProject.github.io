# Code of Conduct

The MELD project is a consortium of epilepsy centres, researchers and developers creating open tools for the automated detection of lesions in patients with epilepsy.

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any MELD project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all time. 

Sophie Adler and Konrad Wagstyl, as leads of the MELD project, and all contributors, are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form.

We are particularly motivated to support people who are looking to learn and develop their programming skills, and who are passionate about creating open tools to be used in a clinical context.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.
* All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.
* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors.
* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

***Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.***

Members of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the MELD project, or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by Sophie Adler. If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with Sophie, the contributor will be asked to discontinue their participation in MELD projects.

To report an issue please contact Sophie Adler (sophie.adler.13@ucl.ac.uk). If your concern is related to Sophie Adler, please contact Torsten Baldeweg (t.baldeweg@ucl.ac.uk). All communication will be treated as confidential.

* Engaging clinicians, researchers and/or developers
