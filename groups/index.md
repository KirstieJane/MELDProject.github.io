Sophie Adler and Konrad Wagstyl set up the MELD Project. 

Sophie is a MBPhD student from University College London who is finishing a PhD on cortical morphometry and MR signal intensity analysis in paediatric epilepsy. Konrad Wagstyl is a MBPhD student from the University of Cambridge who is finishing a PhD on deep learning and cortical structure. This project is supervised by Professor Torsten Baldeweg from the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health.

A number of centres are using the automated FCD detection [code](https://github.com/kwagstyl/FCDdetection) that is freely available to download. We are also collaborating with interested groups to build robust and generalisable tools.

### Groups involved in the multi-centre collaboration

We are delighted that a number of different groups have joined our multi-centre collaboration.

## Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH)
GOSH is a leading centre in paediatric epilepsy surgery in Europe operating on around X children with drug-resistant epilepsy per year. We are working with clinicians such as Professor Helen Cross and Dr Roxana Gunny as well as researchers such as Dr David Carmichael and Dr Sara Lorio.

### Cleveland Clinic 
We are working with Dr Irene Wang's group at the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA. This is one of the largest epilepsy programmes in the world treating both adults and children.  

### National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery
We are working with Dr Gavin Winston's group at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.

## If you are interested in getting involved in this collaboration please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:MELD.study@gmail.com). In particular we are looking for interested epilepsy centres as well as research scientists, developers and database managers. ##
