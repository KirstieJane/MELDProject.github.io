Sophie is a MBPhD student from University College London who is finishing a PhD on cortical morphometry and MR signal intensity analysis in paediatric epilepsy. Konrad Wagstyl is a MBPhD student from the University of Cambridge who is finishing a PhD on deep learning and cortical structure. This project is supervised by Professor Torsten Baldeweg from the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health.

A number of centres are using the automated FCD detection [code](https://github.com/kwagstyl/FCDdetection) that is freely available to download. We are also collaborating with interested groups to build robust and generalisable tools.

### Groups involved in the multi-centre collaboration

We are delighted that a number of different groups have joined our multi-centre collaboration.

### Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH)
GOSH is a leading centre in paediatric epilepsy surgery in Europe. It has had a programme for surgery for treating epilepsy in children since 1992. We are working with clinicians such as Professor Helen Cross and Dr Roxana Gunny as well as researchers such as Dr David Carmichael and Dr Sara Lorio.

### Cleveland Clinic 
We are working with Dr Irene Wang's group at the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA. This is one of the largest epilepsy programmes in the world treating both adults and children.  

### National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery
The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery has the largest adult epilepsy surgery programme in the UK. The Epilepsy Imaging Group of the UCL Institute of Neurology has a long history of developing imaging techniques to improve surgical treatment for patients with epilepsy. We are working with Dr Gavin Winston's group at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.
